"""Natural Pion: spectrum-preserving rotations along the natural gradient.

The method is `natural_pion`: `NaturalPionFast` is the method (Algorithm 2) and, with switches, Algorithm 1 and every
ablation; `NaturalPion` is the earlier angle-rule reference kept for the tests. It is built from the primitives in
`covariance`, `direction`, `factorization`, `linalg` and fed by the recorders in `hooks` (activations for A, output
gradients for D). `pion_baseline` is published Pion, the baseline; `reference` is a numpy oracle for the tests.
